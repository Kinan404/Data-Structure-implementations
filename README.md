# Data Structures Implementation in Java  

## Introduction  
This repository contains my practice implementations of fundamental **Data Structures** while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.  
The project focuses on writing clean and structured code to understand how these data structures work internally.  

The repository includes implementations of:  
- **Linked List** (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)  
- **Stack**  
- **Queue** (Linear and Circular)  

These implementations are written from scratch without using Java’s built-in collections, to strengthen the understanding of the core concepts.

## Implemented Data Structures  

### 1. Linked List  
- **Singly Linked List**  
- **Doubly Linked List**  
- **Circular Linked List**  
- Basic operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, searching.  

### 2. Stack  
- Implemented using arrays.  
- Implemented using linked lists.  
- Supports push, pop, peek, and isEmpty operations.  

### 3. Queue  
- Linear Queue.  
- Circular Queue.  
- Implemented using arrays and linked lists.  
- Supports enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty operations.

## Learning Objectives  
- Understand how data structures work under the hood.  
- Practice implementing operations manually instead of using built-in libraries.  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills with OOP in Java.  
- Learn about time and space complexity in relation to each operation.

## Technologies Used  
- **Java** → Programming language.  
- **Console-based testing** → For verifying implementations.
